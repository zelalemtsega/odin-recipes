    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Shiro is a beloved Ethiopian stew made from ground chickpeas or broad beans, cooked with a rich blend of spices like garlic, ginger, and berbere (a fiery chili spice mix). It has a creamy texture and deep, savory flavors, making it a comforting dish often enjoyed as a daily meal. Shiro is typically served with injera, the Ethiopian sourdough flatbread, which is used to scoop up the stew. It is also a popular choice for vegetarians and those observing fasting periods, as it contains no meat and is a plant-based source of protein.</p>
    <p>Shiro is a staple of Ethiopian cuisine, with regional variations that include additional ingredients like onions, tomatoes, or niter kibbeh (spiced butter) to enhance its richness. It’s often served during both casual meals and special occasions, symbolizing warmth and hospitality. The simplicity of its ingredients belies the depth of flavor that emerges after slow simmering, making it a cherished dish across Ethiopian households and an essential part of the country’s culinary heritage.</p>
<h2>Ingrdients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup shiro powder (ground chickpea or broad bean flour)
    </li>
    <li>1-2 tablespoons berbere (Ethiopian spice blend)
    </li>
    <li>1/4 cup niter kibbeh (Ethiopian spiced butter) or vegetable oil
    </li>
    <li>1 large onion (finely chopped)
    </li>
    <li>2-3 cloves garlic (minced)
    </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ginger (minced)
    </li>
    <li>1-2 tomatoes (chopped, optional for a richer flavor)
    </li>
    <li>2-3 cups water or vegetable broth (adjust based on desired consistency)
    </li>
    <li>Salt to taste
    </li>
    <li>Injera (for serving)
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h4>Sauté the Onions:</h4>
        <p>In a large pan, heat the niter kibbeh (or vegetable oil) over medium heat. Add the finely chopped onions and sauté until they turn soft and golden brown, stirring frequently to avoid burning.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Add Garlic, Ginger, and Berbere:</h4>
        <p>Stir in the minced garlic and ginger, cooking for another minute until fragrant. Then, add the berbere spice blend, mixing thoroughly with the onions to release its deep flavors.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Incorporate Tomatoes (Optional):</h4>
        <p>If you’re using tomatoes for a richer flavor, add the chopped tomatoes at this stage. Cook them down for 5-7 minutes until they soften and blend into the mixture.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Prepare the Shiro Mix:</h4>
        <p>In a separate bowl, gradually mix the shiro powder (ground chickpea or broad bean flour) with some cold water to create a smooth paste. This prevents lumps from forming when added to the stew.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Add Shiro Paste to the Pan:</h4>
        <p>Slowly pour the shiro paste into the pan with the onion and spice mixture, stirring constantly. Gradually add more water or vegetable broth until you achieve the desired consistency (thicker for a heartier stew, thinner for a soup-like texture).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
            <h4>Simmer:</h4>
            <p>Let the mixture simmer on low heat for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. Add salt to taste. If the stew becomes too thick, you can adjust by adding more water or broth.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
            <h4>Serve:</h4>
            <p>Once the shiro has thickened and the flavors have melded, remove from heat. Serve hot with injera, using it to scoop up the creamy stew. <b>Enjoy!</b></p>
