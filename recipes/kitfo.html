    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kitfo is a traditional Ethiopian dish made from finely minced raw or lightly cooked beef, seasoned with a flavorful blend of spices and clarified butter known as "niter kibbeh." The beef is typically mixed with mitmita, a spicy chili powder, and occasionally served with ayib (Ethiopian cottage cheese) and cooked greens like gomen (collard greens). Kitfo is often served with injera, the sourdough flatbread, or kocho, a bread made from the false banana plant. The dish is particularly celebrated for its rich and hearty flavors, offering a savory and slightly spicy taste.

            <h4>Prepare the Beef</h4>
            <p>Start by finely mincing the lean beef or have it minced by a butcher. Ensure the meat is very fresh if you plan to serve it raw or lightly cooked.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Melt the Niter Kibbeh:</h4>
            <p>n a small pan, melt the niter kibbeh (Ethiopian spiced butter) over low heat. Once melted, add the mitmita (Ethiopian chili powder), ground cardamom, and a pinch of salt. Stir the mixture well and let it simmer for a few minutes to release the flavors.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Combine the Beef with Spiced Butter:</h4>
            <p>If serving the kitfo raw or leb leb (lightly cooked), immediately pour the hot, spiced butter mixture over the minced beef. Stir the beef until it's thoroughly coated with the butter and spices. If you prefer the beef lightly cooked, continue stirring it over very low heat for 2-3 minutes until it's just slightly cooked.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Serve:</h4>
            <p>Serve the prepared kitfo with injera or kocho. For a traditional experience, pair the dish with ayib (Ethiopian cottage cheese) and gomen (cooked collard greens). <b>Enjoy the savory, spicy flavors of this unique Ethiopian delicacy!</b></p>
