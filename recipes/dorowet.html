    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Prepare the Chicken:</h4>
            <p>Clean and cut the chicken into pieces. Remove the skin if desired and rinse the chicken with water mixed with lemon juice or vinegar. Set the chicken aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Cook the Onions:</h4>
            <p>In a large pot, add the finely chopped onions and cook on medium heat without oil, stirring constantly to prevent burning. Cook for 15-20 minutes until the onions are soft and golden brown.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Add Niter Kibbeh and Berbere:</h4>
            <p>Add the niter kibbeh (spiced butter) to the onions, allowing it to melt and infuse the onions. Once melted, stir in the berbere spice blend. Adjust the amount of berbere depending on your preferred spice level. Let the mixture simmer for 10 minutes to allow the spices to release their flavors.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Add Garlic, Ginger, and Spices:</h4>
            <p>Stir in the minced garlic and ginger. Add paprika, ground cardamom, black pepper, and salt. Cook the mixture for another 5 minutes, ensuring the spices are well incorporated.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Cook the Chicken:</h4>
            <p>Add the chicken pieces to the pot, coating them thoroughly with the spice mixture. Allow the chicken to sear for a few minutes before adding water or chicken broth. Cover the pot and let it simmer on low heat for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, stirring occasionally.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Add Eggs:</h4>
            <p>Once the chicken is fully cooked and the sauce has thickened, add the hard-boiled eggs to the stew. Let them simmer for another 10 minutes, allowing the eggs to absorb the flavors of the stew.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Serve:</h4>
            <p>Once ready, serve the Doro Wot with injera. Tear off pieces of the injera and use them to scoop up the stew. <b>Enjoy!</b></p>
